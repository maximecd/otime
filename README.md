Otime is an open-source timetracking tool i use internally to track my working hours for my freelance work.

If you are just here to take a look at my work, feel free to create an account on it with a random email adress/name and see by yourself how snappy it is : i do not verify emails yet, this repo and deploy url is just used to showcase my work :)

I plan to write articles on my journey self-hosting and dockerizing a pnpm typescript monorepo, which is why this is repo is open source!

The more i will use the app, the more i plan on improving it, as i get more familiar with AdonisJS (i come from the laravel side :D)

## Installation

If you want to boot up the project in dev mode, it's simple.

After cloning the repository :

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm dev 
```
    
> This will run concurrently all the apps/packages, + a postgres db via docker. You must have docker installed on your machine
## Deployment

> Comming soon
## Tech Stack

Typescript monorepo with pnpm workspace

**Client (apps/web):** SvelteKit in static mode, TailwindCSS, TanStack Query

**Server (apps/api):** AdonisJS
